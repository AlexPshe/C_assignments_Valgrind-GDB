13 line with segfault «ln = strlen(s);»

Explanation:
«s» is an uninitialized pointer and it was writing to a random location in memory. This will invoke undefined behaviour. Need to allocate some memory for «s».
Also, it is wrong to use «gets()». There is no way to prevent it overflowing the memory you allocate. Should use «fgets()» instead.

12 line with segfault «printf ("%s\n", *a);»

Explanation:
First, the memory for the character array is dynamically allocated line 9. 
The pointer "a" contains the address of the first byte of this portion of memory.
Than the pointer references the first byte of the string literal "Hello".
Now in the allocated memory there are «H» and still some uninitialized memory cells.
«printf» function has the specifier "%s", its argument is a string with the end of line "\0". «printf» searches for the end of the line outside of the allocated memory, so there is a segfault.
